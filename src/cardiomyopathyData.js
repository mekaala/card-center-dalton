        info: 'A form of cardiomyopathy related to coronary artery disease where a damaged left ventricle causes blood to be pumped at a lower rate.',
        intro: 'Ischemic cardiomyopathy is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy where an enlarged, dilated, and weakened left ventricle causes blood to be pumped at a lower rate. It is, in fact, caused by ischemia, where the heart receives lower amounts of blood as a result of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (heart attack).',
        causes: 'Ischemia is caused by coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (heart attack), both of which weaken the heart and prompt plaque buildup. Smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity are underlying factors in causing ischemic cardiomyopathy.',
        symptoms: 'Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy may experience shortness of breath, feet and leg swelling, increase in weight, and angina (chest pain and/or chest pressure). Patients may suffer fatigue while exercising, dizziness, and fainting.',
        diagnosis: 'The doctor may use one of many tests to find ischemic cardiomyopathy. Blood tests analyze and search for any chemicals released by the heart when induced by stress cardiomyopathy. Chest X-rays display any fluid present in the lungs, as well as the appearance of the heart and its major blood vessels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluates the electrical activity of the heart, and determines if its performance is hindered by any conditions. An echocardiogram generates images of the beating heart using ultrasound to see if it is beating correctly. Cardiac catheterization monitors heart performance by injecting a catheter into a blood vessel in the arm or leg which travels to the heart. The catheter allows the doctor to take measurements of the heart and blood vessels. A coronary angiography may be performed, which is when a dye is injected to identify any narrow or blocked arteries in an X-ray. A stress test can also help with diagnosing for heart failure by measuring heart performance with exercise, allowing doctors to determine if your heart is pumping enough blood to the rest of the body while exercising.',
        treatment: 'The most convenient treatments are to make changes to your dieting and exercise. Avoid fat and cholesterol heavy meals and focus on improving your wellness. Avoid alcohol and smoking as well, as they can be detrimental to your health. The doctor may prescribe medications to improve cardiac function and combat symptoms of coronary artery disease. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator surgery can be performed to help the heart beat normally. Coronary artery bypass surgery may be conducted to allow blood to avoid sections of arteries that are narrowed or blocked by plaque.',

        offName: 'DILATED CARIOMYOPATHY',
        conditionUrl: 'dilated-cardiomyopathy',
        info: 'A condition involving a weakened heart muscle that fails to pump blood at a normal rate.',
        intro: 'Dilated cardiomyopathy involves a weakened heart muscle that does not pump blood well. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy experience a larger space inside the left ventricle, making it potentially more difficult to pump blood. Those with dilated cardiomyopathy are at risk for developing heart failure, meaning that the heart still works, but it has difficulty with providing the body with the right amount of blood and oxygen with each pump.',
        causes: 'Dilated cardiomyopathy can arise without an underlying cause. It can be genetic, and maybe it can result from a viral illness.',
        symptoms: 'Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy can experience difficulty breathing during exercise or while lying down or asleep. They can also have trouble with exercising or any other physical activity, and suffer swollen feet, ankles, or legs.',
        diagnosis: 'Blood tests analyze and search for any chemicals released by the heart when induced by stress cardiomyopathy. Chest X-rays display any fluid present in the lungs, as well as the appearance of the heart and its major blood vessels.

A coronary angiography may be performed, which is when a dye is injected to identify any narrow or blocked arteries in an X-ray.',
        treatment: 'Lifestyle changes are best heeded when treating dilated cardiomyopathy. Adopt a diet that avoids fats and cholesterol, refrain from smoking and drinking alcohol, and exercise to improve your wellness. In case dilated cardiomyopathy causes heart failure, medications to treat symptoms may be prescribed. Devices that stimulate heart pumping are also beneficial for treating heart failure. Surgeries that improve blood flow by expanding arteries with plaque or creating bypass arteries can treat heart failure.',

        conditionUrl: 'hypertrophic-cardiomypathy',
        info: 'Condition where the heart muscle increases in size, making it more difficult to pump blood.',
        intro: 'Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy involves the heart muscle to increase in size, making it more difficult to pump blood. It can result in difficulty breathing, chest pain, and fainting. The disease can lead to heart failure, heart rhythm disorders, heart block (where electrical signals are blocked from moving through the heart), stroke, heart valve infection, or death.',
        causes: 'The cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is entirely genetic, and does not result from any outside conditions. It can develop during not only adulthood, but teenage years and childhood as well.',
        symptoms: 'Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can experience trouble with breathing (that may occur during exercise, or worsens while lying down but improves when sitting or standing). Chest pain that worsens with activity may occur, as well as a fast heart rate. Patients may experience fainting or feel like fainting, as well as swelling in the feet, ankles, or legs.',
        diagnosis: 'An electrocardiogram can be used to test for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by measuring the electrical activity in the heart, and determine if your heart is beating in a normal pattern and rhythm. An echocardiogram may be suggested to capture images of the beating heart, monitoring the thickness of its walls, as well as the size of the chambers. If one family member has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, then it is suggested that other family members be tested for it as well.',
        treatment: 'Medicine to control the symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy such as chest pain or abnormal heart rhythm is preferred. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator surgery can be performed to help the heart beat normally. Surgery to remove parts of the heart muscle may be performed in case medicines do not work to treat disease.',

        info: 'A stress induced heart condition that triggers breathing problems, chest pain, or even fainting.',
        intro: 'Stress cardiomyopathy, as the name suggests, is a stress induced heart condition that triggers breathing problems, chest pain, or even fainting. Heart performance decreases making pumping more difficult, usually around the apex of the heart (the lower end). As a result, that area of the heart increases in size. Stress cardiomyopathy can cause heart failure (when the heart does not pump blood well), abnormal heart rhythm, and heart valve issues.',
        causes: 'Stress cardiomyopathy results from physical and emotional stresses, and is more commonly found in older women. Such stresses include sudden medical illnesses, the loss of loved ones, or arguments.',
        symptoms: 'The main indicators of stress cardiomyopathy are sudden chest pain, difficulty breathing, or fainting. These symptoms may be brought on by physical and emotional traumas mentioned above.',
        diagnosis: 'These symptoms may be similar to those of a heart attack, so the doctor will need to run some exams to understand your condition. Blood tests analyze and search for any chemicals released by the heart when induced by stress cardiomyopathy. Chest X-rays display any fluid present in the lungs, as well as the appearance of the heart and its major blood vessels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluates the electrical activity of the heart, and determines if its performance is hindered by any conditions.

A coronary angiography may be performed, which is when a dye is injected to identify any narrow or blocked arteries in an X-ray.',
        treatment: 'Medication prescribed by your doctor should counter the symptoms caused by stress cardiomyopathy. The doctor will indicate whether these medications should be taken for a short or an extended time. Recovery from stress cardiomyopathy can be between one to four weeks, but can recur again if not managed well.',
