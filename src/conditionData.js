        name: 'CARDIOMYOPATHY',
        conditionUrl: 'cardiomypathy',
        intro: 'Cardiomyopathy refers to a group of diseases affecting the heart. Commonly, cardiomyopathy can result in an enlarged, thick, rigid heart, or can lead to scar tissue development, weakening the heart itself. Blood flow is more difficult to accomplish, and abnormalities in electrical rhythm arise, possibly causing heart failure, arrhythmias, and heart valve problems.',
        causes: 'There are many possible causes of cardiomyopathy, including heart attacks, congenital heart defects, severe high blood pressure, viral infections, and heart structure abnormalities. In addition, cardiomyopathy can be caused by nutritional deficiencies and some medical conditions like celiac disease, lupus, and end-stage kidney disease. Cardiomyopathy is characterized into three different, specific types: dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive. Dilated cardiomyopathy is caused by an enlarged and poorly functioning left ventricle, which is the heart’s main pumping chamber. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle has become abnormally thick, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood. A heart that may pump normally but does not relax between heartbeats, making it unable to fill up with adequate blood, characterizes restrictive cardiomyopathy.',
        symptoms: 'There are many accompanying symptoms of cardiomyopathy. Shortness of breath is a common symptom that can become worse when laying down flat, and may cause you to wake up at night with a sudden shortness of breath. You may experience fatigue, faintness, dizziness, or light-headedness. You may undergo angina (chest pain), and feel your heart prominently beating or sense a sharp pressure or pain in the middle of your chest. The legs, abdomen, or ankles may swell. It is possible that you will urinate less during the daytime and more at nighttime. You may suffer coughing, high blood pressure, and a loss of appetite. You may find alertness and concentration challenging, and your body’s condition overall will feel weakened.',

        name: 'MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION',
        conditionUrl: 'myocardial-infarction',
        intro: 'Most commonly known as a heart attack, myocardial infarction occurs when one of the coronary arteries (arteries connected to the heart) is blocked. As a result, the section of the heart that receives blood from a coronary artery is damaged. A longer period of a blocked artery means a more severe heart attack.',
        causes: 'Myocardial infarction commonly results from coronary artery disease, where plaque buildup within the arteries interferes with blood flow, potentially forming blood clots. They can block the artery, keeping blood away from the heart.',
        symptoms: 'Chest pain, chest pressure, chest discomfort, irregular heart beat, and shortness of breath are common symptoms of heart attacks. Patients can also experience pain or discomfort in the upper body areas such as the arms, neck, jaw, stomach, and back. Other indicators are nausea, vomiting, burping, or heartburn. Patients can feel dizzy or lightheaded as well as cold or sweaty during a heart attack. Do not take yourself to the hospital or any other medical provider.',
        diagnosis: 'To determine if you are at risk, the doctor may recommend a blood test to find chemicals that indicate if you are suffering a heart attack, an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical activity of the heart, or an echocardiogram to view an ultrasound. A cardiac catheterization may be employed which involves the doctor injecting a tube into one of your vessels at the leg or arm that travels to the heart. Then, a coronary angiography is performed by injecting dye into the tube, indicating any arteries that lead to the heart that are clogged.',
        treatment: 'Heart attacks treated at the hospital involve the medical staff to provide oxygen through a mask or tube in your nose. Pain medicaitons to reduce chest pain and discomfort, blood clot prevention medications, or beta blockers that reduce the required oxygen needed may be recommended. They may conduct one of two methods to regain blood flow. The first is "clot buster" injection, which enters the clogged artery through an IV to dissolve blood clots. The second is a cardiac catheterization stenting procedure, where the doctor inserts a stent (a tiny, metal meshed tube) into the targeted artery to keep it open. If those methods do not resolve the attack, then open heart surgery (coronary artery bypass surgery) is suggested. A bypass involves the creation of a new path around the blood clot using grafts of your other arteries. This surgery allows the blood to take a detour around the blocked area. Patients will need to stay at the hospital for 3 to 5 days to allow their condition to stabilize..',

        name: 'CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE',
        conditionUrl: 'coronary-artery-disease',
        intro: 'Coronary artery disease puts patients at risk for heart attacks and other heart diseases. Coronary arteries are located on the heart, and supply blood to the muscle to keep it functional. Blockages of those arteries severely limit heart function.',
        causes: 'The arteries that lead into the heart are blocked by plaque which causes them to narrow. This narrowing limits blood flow, and plaque can even block the passage entirely, leading to ruptured arteries and other major damage to the heart.',
        symptoms: 'Coronary artery disease is caused by chest pain, chest pressure, chest discomfort, irregular heart beat, and shortness of breath are common symptoms of heart attacks. Patients can also experience pain or discomfort in the upper body areas such as the arms, neck, jaw, stomach, and back. Other indicators are nausea, vomiting, burping, or heartburn. Patients at risk of a heart attack can feel dizzy or lightheaded as well as cold or sweaty during a heart attack. Do not take yourself to the hospital or any other medical provider. Patients with carotid artery disease can have chest pain while walking, traveling up stairs, or participating in an activity even if they are not suffering from a heart attack.',
        diagnosis: 'To determine if you are at risk, an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical activity of the heart or an echocardiogram to view an ultrasound may be used for testing. The doctor may recommend a stress test. You will exercise on a treadmill while having an ECG attached, analyzing if the heart is getting enough blood when under stress. A cardiac catheterization may be employed which involves the doctor injecting a tube into one of your vessels at the leg or arm that travels to the heart. Then, a coronary angiography is performed by injecting dye into the tube, indicating any arteries that lead to the heart that are clogged.',
        treatment: 'The ideal way to reduce risk for coronary artery disease is to make positive changes for your body. Quit smoking, start exercising to gain muscle and lose excess weight, and adopt a low fat and cholesterol diet by eating more fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods. It is also advised to take medications for lowering blood pressure, lowering cholesterol (statins), treating diabetes, and preventing blood clots (aspirin). Medications such as nitrates and beta blockers can also be used to relieve angina, or chest pain caused by coronary artery disease. If you are at high risk, then a stent procedure may be suggested. The stent is inserted into the coronary artery to open it more. Surgery to remove the plaque, carotid endarterectomy, may be suggested if patients suffered from a TIA or stroke caused by plaque buildup. A coronary artery bypass surgery may be needed. It involves the creation of a new path around the blood clot using grafts of your other arteries. This surgery allows the blood to take a detour around the blocked area. Patients will need to stay at the hospital for 3 to 5 days to allow their condition to stabilize.'

        conditionUrl: 'carotid-artery-disease',
        intro: 'Carotid artery disease causes patients to become more susceptible to strokes. The carotid arteries are vessels that carry blood to the brain. When those arteries are blocked, major damage to the brain can occur.',
        causes: 'Carotid artery disease refers to the buildup of plaque inside the carotid arteries, causing them to narrow. This limits blood flow to the brain, resulting in an increased risk of suffering from a stroke.',
        symptoms: 'The major symptom of carotid artery disease is a stroke. Strokes occur when blood flow to the brain is limited or blocked, resulting in brain damage. The blood clots formed in the carotid arteries can move to the brain and block smaller arteries. There are lasting effects from a stroke such as an inability to speak or understand speech, paralysis on one side of the body, an inability to dress, eat, or care for oneself without assistance. Another symptom of carotid artery disease is transient ischemic attack (TIA). They serve as very brief strokes that do not cause brain damage, as plaque can block a brain vessel for a short time and then reopen. However, patients who suffer from TIAs should take serious action against carotid artery disease, as they can result in a major stroke.',
        diagnosis: 'Tests for carotid artery disease involve capturing photos of the arteries. The carotid duplex ultrasound generates pictures from soundwaves similar to an echocardiogram. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) uses magnets to view the arteries that have been indicated by an injected dye via IV. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) involves the analysis of vessels by using a CT scan, a unique X-ray device. A cerebral angiogram may be employed, but it is rarely used.',
        treatment: 'The ideal way to reduce risk for carotid artery disease is to make positive changes for your body. Quit smoking, start exercising to gain muscle and lose excess weight, and adopt a low fat and cholesterol diet by eating more fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods.

        intro: 'Mitral valve prolapse is a condition where the mitral valve, one of the valves in the heart that connects the left atrium to the left ventricle, does not close properly. Normally, the mitral valve allows blood to flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. However, during prolapse, blood can flow back into the left atrium from the left ventricle. This is also known as mitral regurgitation.',

        intro: 'Peripheral arterial disease causes leg pain that becomes more severe with activity or exercise. The disease affects the arteries in the legs, where blood flow can be more difficult, which puts more strain on the body.',
        causes: 'Arteries are usually affected by plaque buildup, which can narrow or block the artery and impact blood flow. As a result, with PAD, legs do not receive enough blood, causing pain in that area. Patients who smoke, and/or have diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure are at higher risk for PAD.',
        symptoms: 'The major indication of PAD is leg pain, specifically in the back of the lower leg. Leg pain worsens while walking or exercising, and improves when relaxing. Sometimes, that pain can even extend to the thighs, feet, and buttocks. Patients suffering from PAD may experience trouble with walking up stairs as well as erection (men) and arousal (women) difficulties.',
        diagnosis: 'There are three tests that can be done for diagnosing PAD. The first is to monitor your blood pressure in your arm and lower leg before and after exercising, and check if there is a major difference. Another is to monitor blood pressure in areas such as the thigh. An ultrasound to view images of your blood vessels may be recommended.',
        treatment: 'The best way to treat PAD is to make positive changes to your lifestyle. Make an effort to quit smoking, as doing so will improve your well-being. If diagnosed with such conditions, manage your diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Walking every day will improve PAD and help your blood flow. The doctor may recommend certain medications to treat symptoms of PAD and improve blood flow. Surgery may be required if symptoms do not improve after making lifestyle changes or taking medication. An angioplasty may be employed to expand the artery. The doctor will implant a tube into the blocked artery, and inflate a balloon within it to open the blockage. A stent may also be used to keep the artery open. Bypass surgery may be recommended. The doctor will make vein grafts out of existing vessels, and reroute blood flow through the new graft, avoiding the blocked site of the artery.',
