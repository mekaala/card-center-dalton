        info: 'An asymptomatic type of heart block that is mild.',
        heartBlock: 'Heart block, or atrioventricular block (AV block), is a condition that impairs the electrical system of the heart that controls heartbeat. Effects of heart block can range from mild to severe. A mild type of heart block slows the heartbeat, or skips beats. A severe type of heart block can stop the heart altogether.',
        causes: 'Heart block can result from a disease, surgery, or medication that damaged the heart, and can even be congenital. That damage to the heart affects the electrical system, and alters it such that it prompts heartbeats to be inconsistent.',
        symptoms: 'First Degree AV Block is the most mild type of heart block. Patients with this condition are asymptomatic.',
        diagnosis: 'The best test to determine if you are suffering from heart block is an electrocardiogram. This test measures the electrical activity of the heart, allowing your doctor to screen for any inconsistencies in heartbeat.',
        treatment: 'If you have first degree heart block, then treatment is not necessary as it is very mild. If you want to prevent heart block, then it is best to make lifestyle changes such as starting a healthy diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dair products (but less meat and fatty foods), engaging in physical activity such as walk almost every day, and losing weight.'

        offName: 'SECOND DEGREE AV BLOCK',
        info: 'This type of heart block is more serious, causing patients to suffer symptoms such as fainting, dizziness, and fatigue. This heart block is split in Mobitz Type I (Wenckebach) and Mobitz Type II.',
        heartBlock: 'Heart block, or atrioventricular block (AV block), is a condition that impairs the electrical system of the heart that controls heartbeat. Effects of heart block can range from mild to severe. A mild type of heart block slows the heartbeat, or skips beats. A severe type of heart block can stop the heart altogether. There are two types of second degree heart block: Mobitz Type I (Wenckebach), and Mobitz Type II. Type I is less serious, and only involves the electrical signal slowing down more and more until the heart skips a beat. Type II is more serious, which is when electrical signals do not reach the ventricles, prompting an irregular heart pattern, and patients may suffer a slower heartbeat.',
        causes: 'Heart block can result from a disease, surgery, or medication that damaged the heart, and can even be congenital. That damage to the heart affects the electrical system, and alters it such that it prompts heartbeats to be inconsistent.',
        symptoms: 'Second Degree AV Block is more serious than its first degree counterpart. Patients suffering from this condition can experience fainting, dizziness, fatigue, difficulty breathing, and chest pain.',
        diagnosis: 'The best test to determine if you are suffering from heart block is an electrocardiogram. This test measures the electrical activity of the heart, allowing your doctor to screen for any inconsistencies in heartbeat.',
        treatment: 'If you have second degree heart block, then a pacemaker might be implanted if it is Type II. A pacemaker regulates and sends proper electrical signals to the heart to help it beat at a normal rate. If you want to prevent heart block, then it is best to make lifestyle changes such as starting a healthy diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dair products (but less meat and fatty foods), engaging in physical activity such as walk almost every day, and losing weight.'
