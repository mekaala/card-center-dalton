        about: 'Also known as the Treadmill Test, the Stress Test measures the physical fitness and performance of the heart and its functions. Patients who experience abnormal heart rhythms or chest pain, or plan to start an exercise regimen take this test. It can also diagnose Coronary Artery Disease.',
        procedure: 'Electrode patches are applied on the body, and a blood pressure cuff is worn on the arm. Heart rate and blood pressure are monitored before and during the test. You will exercise on a treadmill that increases speed and resistance to record blood pressure and the heart’s electrical activity.',
        warning: 'Do not eat, consume caffeine or alcohol, or smoke at least three hours prior to the test. Wear loose fitting clothes to ensure a comfortable procedure. Medications such as beta blockers or digoxin can interfere with the Stress Test, and it is advised to not take them at least 24 hours before the test (Harvard Health).',

        info: 'A stres test that measures heart performance with an intravenous radioactive agent to identify damaged areas of the heart, blocked arteries, and possible risk for heart attack or other cardiac diseases.',
        about: 'Nuclear stress tests display blood flow to the heart muscle using an intravenous radioactive agent and an imaging machine. Images measuring blood flow to the heart are taken while at rest and after exercise. Nuclear stress tests may be recommended to identify areas of the heart that are damaged or have poor blood flow. They can better determine if you are at risk of a heart attack or cardiac diseases such as coronary artery disease (where the heart arteries are clogged by plaque, severely impairing heart function).',
        procedure: 'An IV will be inserted into your arm and a radioactive agent is injected as you lie still on a table. There, images of your heart at rest will be taken. Electrodes will then be placed on your chest, arms, and legs, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) will record the electrical activity of your heart. Blood pressure will also be measured during the test. After capturing the heart at rest, you will exercise on a treadmill or a bike as your doctor evaluates the performance of your heart. Exercise will continue until you reach the age predicted maximum heart rate, or you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, high or low blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythm, dizziness, or abnormal ECG changes. At the peak of your heart rate, you will receive another injection of radioactive agent, and a second set of images of your heart will be captured. If you cannot perform exercise, then the doctor may inject a drug that increases blood flow to your heart. The agent will indicate any areas of the heart receiving inadequate blood flow. The doctor will compare the two sets of images to find any abnormal blood flow while at rest and under stress.',
        warning: 'Do not eat or at least three hours before the test. Do not consume alcoholic beverages at least 24 hours before the test. Your doctor will indicate if you need to stop or change some of your medications before the test, as they may interfere with the results. If used, bring an inhaler to the test. Wear comfortable clothing and footwear that allows for exercise. Do not apply oil products such as lotion to your skin on the day of your test.'

Each heartbeat is captured by a gamma camera, measuring heart pump activity. This test may be employed If other tests such as the ECG or EKG detected any heart problems. It provides an accentuated measurement of heart function.',
        procedure: 'Electrodes are placed on the chest and limbs that connect to an Electrocardiograph, tracking your heartbeat. The radionucleotide is injected through an IV line that is placed into a vein in the arm. You will lie on a table below the gamma camera to receive a “resting” scan.',
        warning: 'Avoid consuming food and beverages containing alcohol or caffeine (coffee, tea, soft drinks) at least four hours prior to your test. Limit consumption to water only. Your doctor will discuss any medications that must be avoided before the test, as they may interfere with the results.',

        info: 'Procedure that displays images of your heart with sound waves sent by a transducer, and can be non-invasive (TTE) or invasive (TEE).',
        about: 'An Echocardiogram creates pictures of your heart as it beats. During echo, the doctor or technician uses a transducer or a probe to send sound waves into the heart. Sound waves create images that show heart chamber size, and how well your heart valves work. There are two types of Echocardiograms. The Transthoracic Echo (TTE) requires the doctor or technician to place the transducer on the outside of the heart. The Transesophageal Echo (TEE) requires the doctor or technician to insert a tube with the transducer down the throat and into the esophagus. An Echo may be needed to: scan the heart and blood vessels around the heart for any problems, check on a known condition, find the cause of symptoms such as shortness of breath, leg swelling, or irregular heartbeats, monitor the heart after a heart attack or surgery, or evaluate the effectiveness of heart medications.',
        procedure: 'The doctor or technician will put electrodes on your chest to monitor your heartbeat. For the TTE, You will lie on your back or left side. The doctor or technician will put some gel on your chest, and press the transducer against your chest and move it around. You may be asked to hold your breath or change positions during the test. Images of your heart will appear on a monitor. For the TEE, an IV will be put in your arm or hand. The doctor will give you medicine through the IV to relax you. Your throat will be numbed by a mouth spray or gargle. A thin tube with a transducer at its bottom will descend into the throat, and be pressed against the esophagus wall to generate images of your heart.',
        warning: 'For a TTE, there is no preparation needed. For a TEE, refrain from eating or drinking at least eight hours before the appointment.',

        about: 'An electrocardiogram measures the electrical activity of the heart and is useful when determining whether or not the heart is beating normally. It is often used for people with suspected heart disease, chest pain, or heart palpitations. An electrocardiogram provides information about the size and location of heart damage, the heart chambers, and the effect of heart regulating medication or a pacemaker.',
        procedure: 'Before your procedure, a technician will apply several discs of electrodes to your skin. The electrodes will send information to a recording machine. At several points during the procedure, a technician will ask you to hold your breath or remain motionless. An echocardiogram is a painless, easy procedure. After the recording machine prints your results, the doctor will review them with you.',

        about: 'Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) involves the large and medium-sized arteries to become narrow or clogged with plaque. This causes pain in the feet and legs, as well as tissue death. Screening provides a non-invasive diagnosis of determining if you have PAD. Individuals who experience pain or numbness in their legs or feet while walking, have shiny skin on their feet, or sores that do not heal should be tested.',
        procedure: 'The screening is simple and non-invasive. Remove socks and shoes. Blood pressure cuffs are placed on the upper arms and ankles. The systolic blood pressure in the limbs is measured by an ultrasound device. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) will be measured, which compares the blood pressure in your arms to the blood pressure in your legs. An ideal ABI is 1.0, meaning that the pressure in the arms and legs is equal. Any value lower or higher than 1 indicates an abnormal range and a risk for PAD development.',
