        about: 'Also known as the Treadmill Test, the Stress Test measures the physical fitness and performance of the heart and its functions. Patients who experience abnormal heart rhythms or chest pain, or plan to start an exercise regimen take this test. It can also diagnose Coronary Artery Disease.',
        procedure: 'Electrode patches are applied on the body, and a blood pressure cuff is worn on the arm. Heart rate and blood pressure are monitored before and during the test. You will exercise on a treadmill that increases speed and resistance to record blood pressure and the heart’s electrical activity.',
        warning: 'Do not eat, consume caffeine or alcohol, or smoke at least three hours prior to the test. Wear loose fitting clothes to ensure a comfortable procedure. Medications such as beta blockers or digoxin can interfere with the Stress Test, and it is advised to not take them at least 24 hours before the test (Harvard Health).',

        about: 'The Multiple-Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA Scan) records cardiac performance with a radioactive tracer (radionucleotide). Each heartbeat is captured by a gamma camera, measuring heart pump activity. This test may be employed If other tests such as the ECG or EKG detected any heart problems.',
        procedure: 'Electrodes are placed on the chest and limbs that connect to an Electrocardiograph, tracking your heartbeat. The radionucleotide is injected through an IV line that is placed into a vein in the arm. You will lie on a table below the gamma camera to receive a “resting” scan. Just like the Exercise Stress Test, you will exercise on a treadmill or a bike to reach the peak activity level. After exercising, you will lie on the table again as the camera records your heart.',
        warning: 'Avoid consuming food and beverages containing alcohol or caffeine (coffee, tea, soft drinks) at least four hours prior to your test. Limit consumption to water only. Your doctor will discuss any medications that must be avoided before the test, as they may interfere with the results.',

        about: 'Also known as an echo, this test uses ultrasound to produce real time images of the heart. Doctors use echoes to view the heart’s structure and functions. They can detect backwards blood flow through the valves (regurgitation), narrow heart valves (stenosis), blood clots within the heart chambers, abnormal holes between chambers, or tumors or infectious growths around the valves. They can also screen for problems with the outer lining (the pericardium) and the large blood vessels that enter and leave the heart.',
        procedure: 'Electrodes are placed on your chest as you lie on a table. The electrodes are connected to an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) that monitors your heartbeat. To view the monitor properly, the room is darkened. A probe will pass across your chest, producing sound waves that travel to the heart. The waves bounce off the heart and return to the probe and will generate a picture of the heart on a monitor. Gel will cover your chest to help pass sound waves through the skin. You may be asked to move or hold your breath to get better pictures.',
        warning: 'Little to no preparation is required. You may consume food and drink, and medications as usual.',

        about: 'An electrocardiogram measures the electrical activity of the heart and is useful when determining whether or not the heart is beating normally. It is often used for people with suspected heart disease, chest pain, or heart palpitations. An electrocardiogram provides information about the size and location of heart damage, the heart chambers, and the effect of heart regulating medication or a pacemaker.',
        procedure: 'Before your procedure, a technician will apply several discs of electrodes to your skin. The electrodes will send information to a recording machine. At several points during the procedure, a technician will ask you to hold your breath or remain motionless. An echocardiogram is a painless, easy procedure. After the recording machine prints your results, the doctor will review them with you.',

        about: 'A Holter monitor uses a battery-operated portable device to measure and record your heart’s activity continuously for 24 to 48 hours. The device has wires with electrodes that attach to your skin.',
        procedure: 'Electrodes are attached to the body as the technician places the Holter Monitor on. The monitor can stay in a pocket or pouch, or slung across your shoulders. Wearing a monitor helps you and the doctor decide whether you should take medication for your heart, or to receive a pacemaker.',
        warning: 'Do not bathe, shower, or swim while wearing the monitor. Do not have X-rays while wearing the monitor. Keep away from high voltage areas.'
