        about: 'Originating from countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, the Mediterranean diet is praised for improving health by many organizations and dieticians. This diet focuses mainly on consuming fruits and vegetables, whole wheat grains, and beans. Moderate amounts of low-fat dairy products, eggs, poultry, and fish are recommended in favor of red meat. The Mediterranean diet is known to reduce risk of heart disease and stroke, as well as obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Using olive oil as a primary fat source can even prevent plaque buildup and keep arteries unclogged.',

        tips: 'Aim for 7 to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Consuming whole grain bread, pasta, and cereal will improve your condition. Replace butter with olive oil when cooking or eating bread. Eat seafood twice a week. If you want to consume red meat, focus on eating leaner proportions. Use herbs and spices to boost the flavor of foods in diet. ',
