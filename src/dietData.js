        about: 'Originating from countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, the Mediterranean diet is praised for improving health by many organizations and dieticians. This diet focuses mainly on consuming fruits and vegetables, whole wheat grains, and beans. Moderate amounts of low-fat dairy products, eggs, poultry, and fish are recommended in favor of red meat. The Mediterranean diet is known to reduce risk of heart disease and stroke, as well as obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Using olive oil as a primary fat source can even prevent plaque buildup and keep arteries unclogged.',

Replace butter with olive oil when cooking or eating bread. Eat seafood twice a week. If you want to consume red meat, focus on eating leaner proportions. Use herbs and spices to boost the flavor of foods in diet.',

        about: 'The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, abbreviated as the DASH diet, is similar to the Mediterranean diet, but primarily focuses on reducing blood pressure to reduce risk of heart disease. Similar to the Mediterranean diet, this diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats such as chicken and fish. The DASH diet benefits patients with high blood pressure because it greatly limits sodium intake (no more than one teaspoon, or 2300 mg per day).',

        tips: 'Only limit salt intake, and do not cut it out of your diet completely. Cook with vegetable or olive oils rather than butter. If you want to use butter, substitute it for margarine. Consume low-calorie drinks such as water or tea. Pair the diet with exercising to experience more health benefits.',
