        offName: 'CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION',
        about: 'Cardiac catheterization is performed when doctors diagnose for certain heart problems, to understand heart performance, or to find underlying reasons for chest pain. The doctor looks at the arteries in the heart to find any blockages (coronary angiography), or find any problems in the heart chambers or valves.',
        procedure: 'You will be awake during the procedure, but also will be administered medication to feel relaxed. An arterial puncture will be made, either at the top, inner part of your leg, or at your wrist, after being numbed. A tube will enter your heart through the artery puncture site and the blood vessels. An X-ray will inform the doctor of when the tube reaches its destination where tests will be performed. For coronary angiography, a contrast dye will be injected, showing any blockages in the arteries. After the procedure, you will need to rest in the hospital for a few hours, and be scheduled a follow up appointment.',
        warning: 'Do not consume food after midnight during the night before the procedure. It is unlikely, but you may be advised to avoid taking certain medications. The doctor will inform you of any medications that should not be administered. You will be informed if you need someone else to drive you to and from the hospital, and you may stay overnight if any artery repair is performed.'

        offName: 'PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI)',
        about: 'Also known as a coronary angioplasty, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a minimally invasive and nonsurgical procedure used to improve blood flow of segments around the heart area. It generally uses stents to open and sustain blood flow by inflating a balloon in the clogged artery to expand the vessel. PCI is performed to prevent chest pain and heart attacks due to blocked arteries.',
        procedure: 'PCI is performed through an artery in the groin, arm, or wrist, generally without anesthesia. An IV catheter will be placed in your hand and arm to provide fluids and medications to relax you. A local anesthetic will numb the area of incision. Contrast dye will indicate clogged arteries on an X-ray, and a thin wire with the balloon will be inserted into the blood vessel. The balloon will be inflated at the site of blockage, stretching the artery. Upon completion, the balloon deflates, and a stent is implanted to keep the artery open.',
        warning: 'Avoid food or drink for at least six hours before the procedure. The doctor will indicate any medications to avoid taking as they may interfere with the procedure. Arrange for transportation to and from the hospital as PCI may require an overnight stay, and you may not be able to drive home.',

        offName: 'CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS SURGERY',
        about: 'Coronary artery bypass surgery treats coronary heart disease (where the arteries connected to the heart are clogged by fatty deposits, blocking blood flow). The surgeon creates grafts from healthy blood vessels from other parts of the body that are attached above and below the blockage. This creates an alternate route for blood to flow around the blockage. They can also redirect an artery from the chest muscle to the heart. Coronary artery bypass surgery is mainly recommended to patients with chest pain that does not resolve with medication or stenting, or blockages that may result in a heart attack or death.',
        procedure: 'Anesthesia will be administered to sedate and make you unconscious during the surgery. The surgeon will make an incision over your breastbone, and split it to access your heart. The surgeon will also cut out pieces of blood vessels from the arms, legs, belly, or within the chest to use as grafts. While applying the grafts to the grafts, a heart-lung machine will help continue your blood flow throughout the body. The heart may need to be stopped as coronary artery bypass surgery is too risky to perform while the heart is active. Upon attachment, you will be taken off the machine, and the breastbone and skin are put back together.',
        warning: 'Coronary artery bypass surgery is intensive, please follow all precautions. Do not consume food or drink after midnight on the day of the procedure. The doctor will inform you of certain medications that should not be taken at least several days before the surgery. More detailed preparations will be given when scheduling the procedure. After the surgery, you will spend 1 to 2 days in the ICU, regaining strength. The wound will be sore for 2 to 3 days more, but pain medications will help.',

        about: 'A pacemaker is a device that sits under the skin near the heart that treats an abnormal heart rate. It regulates the electric system of the heart, allowing it to pump blood at a normal rate. Pacemakers send electrical signals to the heart, causing a slow or fast heartbeat to return to the normal rate. There are two parts to a pacemaker: the pulse generator - a thin, metal case with a battery and computer that creates and sends electrical signals, and leads - wires that connect the pulse generator to the heart.',
        procedure: 'The doctor will give you a sedative to relax as well as an anesthetic to numb the incision site. You will be awake during the procedure. An incision will be made near your shoulder. A wire will be guided to a major vein in your collarbone, and make its way into the heart. An electrode will be attached to the right ventricle, and the other end will be attached to a pulse generator, which will be implanted under the skin near the collarbone. The incision will be closed with stitches after the implantation.',
        warning: 'Do not consume any food or drink on the day of the surgery. The doctor will indicate which medicines to stop taking as they may interfere with the procedure. There may be medications that the doctor will prescribe for you before the test. Take them. To prevent serious infections, shower and shampoo well. You may be required to use a special body soap.'

        procedure: 'A small incision is made on the left side at about the level of the second or third rib. A pocket is created under the skin, and the device is inserted in that pocket, and then the incision is closed. The device is usually implanted by an electrophysiologist as an outpatient procedure using local anesthesia. Conscious sedation can be used but is generally not required. Once implanted, the device is activated by passing a magnet over it.',
        warning: 'It is advised that you refrain from eating or drinking after midnight before your procedure. You will be informed if any medications should not be taken before the implantation.',

        about: 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) involves the insertion of a new aortic valve without removing the damaged valve. Damaged valves arise due to aortic stenosis, when the aortic valve does not open fully, limiting blood flow. TAVR uses balloons to inflate the valve, allowing blood flow to resume its ideal rate. There are usually no symptoms reported for early aortic stenosis, but heart murmurs detected in routine exams can be a sign of the condition. Symptoms of aortic stenosis such as shortness of breath, dizziness or fainting, and chest pain can appear during physical activity.',
        procedure: 'You will be administered anesthesia at the site of incision, and will be conscious during the procedure. Just like with cardiac catheterization, a wire will approach the valve through a vessel in the arm or leg that leads to the heart. A coronary angiography is performed to diagnose if you are suffering from aortic stenosis by injecting dye that highlights narrowed or blocked arteries on an X-ray. The doctor will inflate a balloon in the narrowed valve to expand it.',
        warning: 'Do not consume food after midnight during the night before the procedure. It is unlikely, but you may be advised to avoid taking certain medications. The doctor will inform you of any medications that should not be administered.

        about: 'An implantable cardioverter defribrillator (ICD) goes under the skin near the heart, and can monitor for and treat abnormal heartbeats. An abnormal heartbeat can be too slow or too fast, or it can beat in an irregular rhythm. These abnormal heartbeats can prevent blood from being pumped to the brain and the body, and can lead to fatal conditions such as cardiac arrest. Patients with ICDs can survive cardiac arrest because the device can treat those abnormal heartbeats. Patients may need an ICD if they have experienced abnormal heartbeats, or have conditions that cause abnormal heartbeats.',
        procedure: 'Sedatives will be given to relax you during the procedure. Anesthesia may be applied as well. The doctor will insert wires (leads) into the veins near the collarbone and will guide them to the heart. The leads are attached to the heart, and the other ends are attached to the ICD battery, which has been implanted near the collarbone. After the procedure, you will stay in the hospital until the sedatives or anesthesia has worn off. Refrain from making any sudden movements such as raising your left arm for at least two weeks. Driving during this time is not recommended either.',
        warning: 'Please do not consume any food or drink for at least eight hours before your surgery. Your doctor will inform you of which medications you can or cannot take during this time. Please arrange for someone to drive you not only to and from the hospital, but also for at least two weeks.',
