        info: 'Chest pain and discomfort occurs between your upper abdomen and neck, and results from the heart muscle not receiving an adequate amount of blood and oxygen.',
        definition: 'Chest pain is pain or discomfort that occurs anywhere along your front side between the upper abdomen and neck. When the heart muscle does not receive proper blood and oxygen flow, it results in chest pain and discomfort called angina. The most common cause of angina is coronary artery disease, which causes arteries to become very narrow or blocked. Lack of blood in the heart tissue causes chest discomfort that may last for several minutes, particularly during physical activity. However, angina can be treated with medication, rest, surgery, and cardiac rehabilitation.',
        pOne: 'Coronary artery disease caused by hardening of the arteries, called atherosclerosis, is the most common cause of angina. At fist, arteries will be narrowed due to plaque formation. As time goes on, the plaques may rupture, forming an artery-blocking clot or plug. Oxygen and blood cannot make their way to the heart muscle when an artery is blocked or narrowed, resulting in discomfort, particularly during exertion. There are several other less common factors that can cause angina, including valvular heart disease, spasm of the artery, uncontrolled high blood pressure, and an enlarged heart.',
        pTwo: 'Symptoms of angina worsen when the heart lacks enough blood and oxygen. You may notice increased pain and discomfort after exercise or exertion through basic daily tasks like carrying in groceries, climbing stairs, or sex. Angina may also occur when you are stressed, angered, or emotionally upset. Experiencing very hot or cold temperatures or having a full stomach may also trigger angina. The chest discomfort caused by angina usually lasts one to five minutes, typically feeling like burning, pressure, heaviness, squeezing, tightness, or pain. Angina discomfort usually affects the neck, jaws, chest, back, arms, shoulders, and stomach area. Additionally, your wrists, shoulders, and arms may tingle or experience numbness. You may sweat, feel nauseated, and have difficulty breathing.',
        pThree: 'There are several tests that can identify angina, such as an exercise stress test, coronary angiogram, nuclear stress test, and electrocardiogram (ECG).',
        pFour: 'Depending on the severity and type of angina, there are a variety of treatments available. Often, nitroglycerin medication is prescribed for angina relief. Your doctor may prescribe other medications, based on your condition, to thin your blood, regulate your heartbeat, relieve anxiety, or lower your blood pressure. Your doctor may also mandate cardiac rehabilitation in order to improve your circulation and strengthen your heart muscles. Depending on the type of angina, hospitalization may be required.',
        pFive: 'Surgery may be recommended in some cases. One such surgery is coronary angioplasty, which opens blocked coronary arteries, and may involve inserting a stent to guarantee that the artery remains open even after the angioplasty. Another surgery is coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), where surgeons will create a detour around a clogged artery by taking a blood vessel from somewhere else in the body, restoring blood flow to your heart. Often, blood vessels are taken from the leg to be connected surgically to the coronary artery. Sometimes, multiple bypass surgeries may be necessary to address several blocked coronary arteries.',
        pSix: 'It is possible to decrease your risk of angina by changing your lifestyle to eliminate risky behaviors. Your risk of angina may decrease if you maintain healthy cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, and weight levels. If you are a smoker, quitting is paramount. If you struggle with quitting smoking, ask your doctor about products and support systems that can help you quit. A healthy, well-balanced diet of low sodium, low sugar, and low fat meals and regular exercise can help you maintain a strong heart.',
        pSeven: 'There are many factors that increase your likelihood of developing angina, such as: cigarette smoking, hardening of the arteries, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, family history of heart disease, sedentary lifestyle, and drug use. However, some people develop angina even without engaging in any risk factors.',

        info: 'Known as dyspnea, it can affect the heart, lungs, or blood vessels. It can impact the delivery of oxygen to your tissues.',
        definition: 'Shortness of breath is a common health problem that is medically known as dyspnea. It occurs when there are problems that affect either the heart, blood vessels, breathing passages, or lungs. Many cases of dyspnea are due to lung or heart conditions. Your lung and heart play critical roles in delivering vital oxygen to your tissues while removing harmful carbon dioxide, so issues with either of these important processes can affect your breathing negatively.',
        pOne: 'The sensation of shortness of breath is often characterized as difficulty breathing, uncomfortable breathing, and the feeling that you are breathing an insufficient amount of air.',
        pTwo: 'Shortness of breath may be caused by numerous factors such as anemia, asthma, pneumonia, bronchitis, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, lung cancer, allergic reaction, obesity, rib fracture, anaphylaxis, emphysema, high altitude, rib fracture, interstitial lung disease, and aerobic exercise. It may also be caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, heart attack, heart arrhythmias, heart failure, low blood pressure, and upper airway obstruction.',
        pThree: 'Dyspnea may be associated with symptoms of dizziness, chest pain, fainting, neck pain, wheezing, and chest injury.',
        pFour: 'In some cases, shortness of breath is to be expected and is not a cause for concern. Many people experience shortness of breath after strenuous exercise, particularly if you do not exercise often. Alternatively, a stuffy nose is another example of a normal reason for difficulty breathing.',
        pFive: 'If you experience chronic shortness of breath, this condition may be due to heart dysfunction, obesity, interstitial lung disease, or asthma. Aside from these conditions, shortness of breath often indicates a possible medical problem. Particularly if the onset of your shortness of breath is severe and sudden, seek medical attention as soon as possible.',

        info: 'Palpitations signify a racing or pounding heart sensation which can be felt in the neck, throat, or chest, and feels like your heart is skipping beats.',
        definition: 'Heart palpitations are the sensations of a racing or pounding heart, and can be felt in the neck, throat, or chest. You may feel like your heart is skipping beats and experience an unpleasantly heightened awareness of your heartbeat. When you have heart palpitations, the heart’s rhythm may be abnormal.',
        pOne: 'The heart normally beats anywhere from 60 to 100 times per minute. If your heart rate is over 100 beats per minute, it is abnormally fast in a condition called tachycardia. Having an occasional extra heartbeat is called extrasystole.',
        pTwo: 'While the heart palpitations themselves are usually harmless and not serious and, they can indicate a much more serious underlying condition. Heart palpitations can, in rare cases, be classified as arrhythmia, abnormal heart rhythm, which may be caused by conditions including: an abnormal heart valve, significant risk factors for developing heart disease, existing heart disease, and an electrolyte abnormality in your blood. Electrolyte abnormalities may be due to something like a low potassium level.',
        pThree: 'Your doctor will be able to determine if your heart palpitations are due to an underlying cause and then prescribe the correct treatment. If your palpitations are not associated with an underlying cause, you can help prevent them with lifestyle changes such as stress management and avoiding smoking and caffeine.',
        pFour: 'Heart palpitations may be caused by caffeine, nicotine, exercise, diet pills, fever, cocaine or other illegal drugs, stress, anxiety, fear, or panic attack. Some palpitations may be due to an overactive thyroid, certain medicines, heart disease, abnormal blood level of potassium, abnormal heart valve, or low oxygen level in the blood.',
        pFive: 'You can help reduce or prevent heart palpitations by reducing anxiety and stress, decreasing your caffeine and nicotine intake, practicing meditation or yoga, quitting smoking, and exercising on a regular basis.',
        pSix: 'Call your doctor immediately if you feel extra heartbeats, have risk factors for heart disease, have different or new palpitations, or have a pulse that has quickened to more than 100 beats per minute without fever, anxiety, or exercise. Call for emergency medical services if you experience chest pain, loss of consciousness, unusual sweating, shortness of breath, or dizziness.',

        info: 'Known as syncope, fainting occurs when the heart rate or blood pressure drops, and can be triggered by stress, dehydration, or exhaustion.',
        definition: 'Syncope is the medical term for fainting. Syncope occurs after a drop in heart rate or blood pressure, and may be triggered by stress, dehydration, or exhaustion. Recurrent syncope may be a warning sign of a heart condition. Contact your doctor to figure out the cause of your fainting and receive corresponding treatment.',
        pOne: 'Syncope results from a reduction in blood flow to the brain, which causes temporary loss of consciousness. Fainting is brief. Afterward, there is a complete recovery of consciousness. There are many potential causes of syncope, including heavy sweating, dehydration, blood loss, exhaustion, pain, fear, emotional stress, or standing up too quickly. Certain medications, alcohol or illegal drug use, and hyperventilation can also cause syncope. Other causes include a bowel movement, urination, coughing, and sitting or standing for prolonged periods of time.',

        pFour: 'Syncope may be the sign of a serious underlying disorder in some cases. Syncope that occurs with irregular heartbeats, heart palpitations, or exercise may be related to a heart problem. Family history of recurrent syncope or sudden death may indicate that a person has a higher risk of cardiac-related syncope. Heart disease-related syncope can result in heart attack, stroke, or sudden death.',
        pFive: 'Prior to fainting, you may experience nausea, dizziness, weakness, lightheadedness, paleness, sweat, and a ringing in your ears. Sounds may seem to fade out and your vision may seem to become gray. Symptoms will last briefly, usually for a few seconds, before there is a temporary loss of consciousness. Although you may feel nauseated and sweaty, recovery from fainting is quick.',
        pSix: 'Your doctor will determine if you had a simple bout of fainting, a seizure, or a heart condition. You doctor will examine your nervous system, lungs, and heart before measuring your blood pressure while you are in different positions. If your doctor suspects that you have a heart problem, they will perform some cardiac tests, including a chest X-ray, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, and exercise stress test.',
        pSeven: 'Your doctor may also perform a tilt table testing, which checks for sudden drops in heart rate or blood pressure that cause syncope. During this procedure, you will be secured to a table that inclines to several positions over time. Your doctor will record your blood pressure and heart’s electrical activity.',
        pEight: 'People neurally mediated syncope may be treated with medication. A doctor may recommend that they eat a diet high in salt and drink plenty of fluids. When they feel the warning signs of fainting, they should sit or lie down. Wearing compression stocking may benefit circulation, as can orthostatic training exercises. In some cases, a patient may need a pacemaker to help regulate their heart function.',
        pNine: 'Follow your doctor’s recommendations carefully if you have neurally mediated syncope. Lie down and elevate your legs if you feel the warning signs of fainting. Attend all of your scheduled doctor’s appointments.',

        definition: 'Everybody feels weary and tired at one time or another. Usually, this is temporary fatigue with a clear cause like a late night at the office or staying up with the baby. However, chronic fatigue is persistent and more profound. Fatigue is the perpetual feeling of low energy, poor mental capacity, and constant weariness.',
        pOne: 'Although fatigue is not synonymous with drowsiness, it is often associated with a strong desire to sleep and not do much else. Fatigue negatively affects your psychological and emotional states.',
        pTwo: 'In many cases, fatigue can be linked back to some of your lifestyle choices and habits, including caffeine or alcohol consumption, lack of sleep, inactivity, poor diet, certain medications, or excessive physical activity. Sometimes, it is a common symptom of mental health issues like stress, depression, grief, and anxiety. In other cases, fatigue is the outward symptom of an underlying medical issue, including heart disease, emphysema, cancer, anemia, acute liver failure, obesity, sleep apnea, either type of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or restless legs syndrome.',
        pThree: 'Contact your doctor if your fatigue continues for more than two weeks despite your efforts to reduce stress, eat a healthy diet, drink enough fluids, and rest. Seek immediate medical attention if, in addition to your fatigue, you experience severe headache, severe pelvic, back, or abdominal pain, chest pain, irregular or quick heartbeat, shortness of breath, faintness, or abnormal bleeding.',
        pFour: 'Your doctor can help determine the cause of your fatigue by observing its pattern. If you wake up with very little energy and experience fatigue all throughout the day, you may have depression. If you wake up feeling rested and energized but rapidly feel fatigued with activity, you may have a medical condition like an underactive thyroid.',

        pTwo: 'Edema occurs when your capillaries, the tiny blood vessels that flow throughout your body, leak fluid. When this fluid builds up in the adjacent tissues, that area of the body swells. You may have mild cases of edema due to pregnancy, overconsumption of salty food, premenstrual symptoms, or sitting or remaining in one position for an extended period of time. Edema may also be a side effect of medications like estrogens, steroids, high blood pressure medications, certain diabetes medications (thiazolidinediones), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.',
        pThree: 'Edema can often be relieved with a reduction of salt intake and consumption of medication that removes excess fluid. However, if edema is the symptom of an underlying medical problem, that medical problem requires separate, specific treatment.',
