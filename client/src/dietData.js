        info: 'The Mediterranean diet can reduce risk of heart disease and stroke, along with obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.',
        about: 'Originating from countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, the Mediterranean diet is praised for improving health by many organizations and dieticians. This diet focuses mainly on consuming fruits and vegetables, whole wheat grains, and beans. Moderate amounts of low-fat dairy products, eggs, poultry, and fish are recommended in favor of red meat. The Mediterranean diet is known to reduce risk of heart disease and stroke, as well as obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Using olive oil as a primary fat source can even prevent plaque buildup and keep arteries unclogged.',

        info: 'The TLC diet treats high levels of bad cholesterol, which can reduce risk of coronary artery disease by limiting cholesterol and saturated fat intake.',
        about: 'The Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet can treat low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, also known as "bad" cholesterol. Generally, cholesterol is used to make substances such as hormones, bile acids, and vitamin D. However, LDL cholesterol travels to the tissues, and can block blood flow within the arteries. High levels of LDL cholesterol, especially in the coronary arteries, can increase risk for heart disease. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nonfat to low-fat dairy products, and poultry and fish are recommended for this diet. The TLC diet aims to reduce cholesterol intake to less than 200 mg per day, as well as lowering saturated fat and trans fat intake.',

This diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats such as chicken and fish. The DASH diet benefits patients with high blood pressure because it greatly limits sodium intake (no more than one teaspoon, or 2300 mg per day).',
